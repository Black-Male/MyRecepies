# MyRecepies

MyRecepies is a tool for finding recepies. The food items are displayed on the webpage and the user can click on them to view the recepies

# How It Works

My Project works through the use of an API [https://www.themealdb.com/api.php].
I use this API to acquire information on the recipes so that ican display them on my page.

the project containsa a dummy click to login with the login button existing in the top left corner of the page, no specific password or username is required as it is just a login page. The dummy login will just close if you click login or the x buttin in its top left corner

# Launching the project
to launch the project, not much is needed one just needs to clone the work from github into their local environment, make sure that they have a stable internet connection so that the API can actually be fetched 

open the work can be done through vsCode or any another text editor you have on your device. The text editor is needed so as to see what scripting the work actually uses. 

the project can also be launched through the link in the page description.
